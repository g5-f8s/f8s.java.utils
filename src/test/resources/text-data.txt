The first model of Aston Martin's "second-century plan", the DB11—like its predecessor and its platform siblings—incorporates aluminium extensively throughout its body.

Official manufacture of the DB11 began at the Aston Martin facility in Gaydon, Warwickshire, in September 2016.
Two engine configurations of the DB11 were available: a 4.0-litre V8-engine model produced by Mercedes-AMG and a 5.2-litre V12-engine model produced by Aston Martin.
The Volante version of the DB11 was introduced in October 2017.
In 2018, Aston Martin and its racing division replaced the DB11 V12 with the DB11 V12 AMR, which brought an increased engine output.
The V8-powered model also received an enhancement in engine performance in 2021.
